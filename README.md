# Turtlebot3-Bumper-Code
Bumper code for Turtlebot3 to avoid obstacles and mark them on the map that generates when scanning a room.
Turtlebot3 uses a lidar sensor for SLAM and obstacle avoidance, but since the lidar sensor can only see above 7 inches high the bumpers would help to detect
objects under 7 inches high.
